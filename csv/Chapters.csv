Welcome!,media/1NcGGriRaNWYYCRZgKnYcDZlJ9YbfjCCL.jpg,,,"Hello and welcome to the Marin County Breeding Bird Atlas story map for 2022! We are still getting photo submissions, as new submissions come in they are added to the end of this list in the order they are recieved. As you scroll down the list you will see lots of awesome volunteer submitted photos of what they saw in their block along with a little backstory on their photo. The pins represent the center point of a survey block, they <b><u>do not</u></b> represent bird locations. Click on the photos to see them full screen. If you are a volunteer who has just made a submission it may take a few days for the photo to show in this map, although your story should appear very quickly.",10,Hidden,blue,Welcome!,38.07294,-122.73438,,,,,10

I took the photos from the car parked right next to the cavity nest in the post. It is a parking area and people are walking past the nest constantly during the day, with which the Flickers seem unconcerned. The adult and possibly another fledgling were in the cypress tree nearby. ",14,Plain,blue,3-15,38.09377,-122.92188,,,,,

This is a mix of adult and fledgling Double Crested Cormorants that have taken over a long established Great Blue Heron nest. The Cormorants arrived in early April when this was a stage 4 nest (Young at nest without adult in attendance) and the Cormorants may have precluded the normal development of the young herons to full fledging. This is Sylvie's block and she seems to have done an amazing job.,14,Plain,blue,13-24,37.88447,-122.50537,,,,,

Beginning with finding the best site for a hanging nest, then bringing lots of fluffy materials, working so diligently. When the eggs hatch the work begins finding the bright green caterpillars to feed their young. Now the adults bring their juveniles to this suet feeder for a feeding party. Traveling in sizable groups they are perky and festive in presence.",14,Plain,blue,12-3,38.09377,-122.60938,,,,,

Photo #2 (bottom): I was hiking up near the Pierre Joske Grove on Mt. Burdell and heard a lot of Common Raven squawking going on so I headed upslope to see what was going on.  It turned out that one of the parents had delivered food to 3 fledglings in a fallen oak tree. The fledglings were hopping around from branch to branch but apparently unable to fly.  An adult returned nearby to check on them and they quietly communicated back and forth with each other, then the adult took off again.",14,Plain,blue,11-11,38.13542,-122.60938,,,,,
