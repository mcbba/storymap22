Welcome!,media/1NcGGriRaNWYYCRZgKnYcDZlJ9YbfjCCL.jpg,Artwork by Emily Robinson,,"Hello and welcome to the Marin County Breeding Bird Atlas story map for 2021! As you scroll down the list you will see lots of awesome volunteer submitted photos of what they saw in their block along with a little backstory on their photo. The pins represent the center point of a survey block, they <u> do not</u> represent bird locations. Click on the photos to see them full screen. Thanks to all of our volunteers for making this a great season!",10,Hidden,blue,Welcome!,38.07294,-122.73438,,,scripts/lightbox/css/css.geojson,color:black;weight:3;fillOpacity:0;opacity:1,10
11-11,media/1WiOmhevj6PYufwN3RByFyy5hdLfEzngg.jpeg,"Photo: Becky Matsubara, Block Leader: Daphine Hatch",,"Ann Linder and Scott Buchanan were birding along the Dwarf Oak Trail on Mt. Burdell when Scott spotted this Western Screech Owl roosting in an oak cavity.  Hoping that they may have found a nest, Ann took me to the location 2 days later- no owl present, so guessing it was a day roost, though Birds of the World indicates they donâ€™t roost in cavities except in winter and early spring.  Excited to confirm Western Screech Owl is present in the block. ",14,Plain,blue,11-11,38.13542,-122.60938,,,,,14
13-20,media/1jtN2cR0RpcZ87pJTaIfalTYVuzDYAfSH.jpg,Ron Brown,,"This shows the Adult and chicks of Forster's Terns on the nest on July 8th. There were 3 nests at this location and 2 produced chicks, as of July 25th the chicks of these 2 nests are progressing, hopefully to full fledging. The chicks are mostly unattended by the parents now and pop in and out of the weeds onto the beach area of the small island. The adults are nearby chasing of any predators. It was fun to watch a parent shepherding a Turkey Vulture away from the location of the chicks, they also have a busy time with the gulls in the area and have escorted Caspian Terns away from the chicks also. The parents do not want to alert predators to the location of the chicks and seem to feed them by placing small fish near to the chicks and immeadiately flying off.

13-24,media/1vNesHlatYE28OUMlUPjqg_yhXPu8SqMz.jpg,Ron Brown,,"This is a Double Crested Cormorant nest with chicks (the chicks are a little hard to spot but they are the black blobs next to the parent) taken on June 11th. There were 6 Cormorant nests in the long established colony of Great Blue Herons and Great Egrets at this location. As of July 25th all 6 nests seem to have been successful. One of the small cup shaped nests seemed to have 4 chicks but it does not take long for the chicks to become the same size as the parents and are hard to tell apart. There were 2 types of nests, one built on the top side of the large branch and others in the crook of branches. Most nests were around the same branch, the cup shaped nests on the bare branch appear to break apart as the chicks grow, the nests in the crook of branches seem to retain their structure. There have never been DCCO in this colony and MCBBA 1 states that DCCO at that period of time were very limited breeders in Marin County (and not in this block). So an exciting development to witness although the smell is not so exciting.   ",14,Plain,blue,13-24,37.88447,-122.50537,,,,,
12-18,media/1k87Av8qgct9mL-MohxXx9YqA2n6WTqj6.jpg,Ron Brown,,"This photo was taken on April 20th and the 2 Great Horned Owl chicks and attending adult are well camoflaged and blend in with their surroundings. This nest is right in the middle of the Colony of a large number of Great Egrets and a few Great Blue Heron nests at Bel Marin Keys. The site monitor for the ""HEP"" study of ""Audubon Canyon Ranch (ACR)"" indicates there may be problems with predation of the Egret nests this year. The predation may not be due to the presence of the owls only as Crows have been seen predating the eggs of the Egrets (personal observation). We will have to wait and see what happens with nesting next year at this colony! ",14,Plain,blue,12-18,38.07308,-122.50804,,,,,
12-4,media/18dg9it0z_FJEhKNsgHp1LaudnaBaTf23.JPG,Joel Hedgpeth,,"Got my binoculars to see why a California Towhee was on top of a bird house and was shocked (but pleased) to see a Western Screech-Owl behind it in a niche under the eaves. This made me look more closely in the nearby tree that had ""whitewash"" under it. I found four very well camouflaged owls...one adult and three fledglings. Since then they have entertained us by their daily movement. First one adult left, and a few days later the other did likewise. The three ""babies"" have remained, apparently on their own, leaving at dusk, but always back when we awaken the next morning. They're too cool!",14,Plain,blue,12-4,38.09377,-122.57813,,,,,

This Hooded Oriole nests in our neighborhood palm tree. He, the female and their juveniles visit our feeders regularly.

Len Blumin photographed this Killdeer chick at the Las Gallinas Sanitary District on June 1. He observed two chicks foraging on the muddy shoreline at the northwest corner of the first pond, about ten feet away from the parent. Since the chicks were still in the downy stage, Len estimated that they were about 2-3 weeks old. Note the long toes, which keep them from sinking into the mud. Killdeer have a long tail, even the chicks. ",14,Plain,blue,12-22,38.03138,-122.51391,,,,,

All was quiet when a thin persistent baby bird call caught our attention. ""Mamma, Mamma, I am hungry"". Soon after mamma obliged, quickly delivered lunch and left. Baby began crying again. Daddy on a nearby branch started giving a few ""chuwee"" calls, probably asking baby to please stop telling the world where she was! Mamma continued bringing food and baby cried a little more, but seemed to get tired. Although we knew of the Pacific-slope Flycatcher presence in the area, we had never seen breeding evidence of any sort. Sometimes you need the help of a cute tiny fledgling to alert you.
